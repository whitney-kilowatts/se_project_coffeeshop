# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future I'd like to add a feature that gives guests the option to reserve a laptop from the library when they reserve a table in the coffeeshop.

I would also like to add an events section since the library sometimes holds classes and live music in the coffee shop during the evenings.

It would be nice to have an input field where guests could request a class or event they'd like to see to give library staff a feel for what kind of things the community is interested in!
